##What is Gorilla Audio

Gorilla Audio is an attempt to make a free, straightforward,  
cross-platform, high-level software audio mixer that supports   
playback of both static and streaming sounds. It is intended for  
video game development, but should easily support many other real-time   
audio software applications.


The library is written in ANSI C, and is licensed under the MIT license.   
It was written by Tim Ambrogi, engine programmer at Final Form Games.


Gorilla Audio code includes some other libraries that are licensed under   
terms other than MIT. This includes code under the Xiph and LGPL licenses.   
Non-MIT code in the repository is denoted by COPYING files.
